# Contributing

When contributing to US-RSE Python, it is
important to properly communicate the gist of the contribution.
If it is a simple code or editorial fix, simply explaining this
within the GitHub Pull Request (PR) will suffice. But if this is a larger
fix or Enhancement, it should be first discussed with the project
leader or developers.

Please note we have a code of conduct, and you should follow it.

## Pull Request Process

1. Bug fix PRs should be sent to the main branch from a fork or development branch.
2. Follow the existing code style precedent. This does not need to be strictly
   defined as there are many thousands of lines of examples. Note the lack
   of tabs anywhere in the project, parentheses and spacing, documentation
   style, source code layout, variable scoping, and follow the project's
   standards.
3. Test your PR locally, and provide the steps necessary to test for the
   reviewers.
4. The project's default copyright and header have been included in any new
   source files.
5. All (major) changes to must be documented in the "docs" folder.
   If your PR changes a core functionality, please
   include clear description of the changes in your PR so that the docs
   can be updated, or better, submit another PR to update the docs directly.
6. If necessary, update the README.md.
7. The pull request will be reviewed by others, and the final merge must be
   done by the project lead, @vsoch (or approved by her).
