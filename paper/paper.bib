abstract = {In this paper, we examine the state of software engineering (SE) research from the point of view of the following research questions:1.What topics do SE researchers address?2.What research approaches do SE researchers use?3.What research methods do SE researchers use?4.On what reference disciplines does SE research depend?5.At what levels of analysis do SE researchers conduct research? To answer those questions, we examined 369 papers in six leading research journals in the SE field, answering those research questions for each paper. From that examination, we conclude that SE research is diverse regarding topic, narrow regarding research approach and method, inwardly-focused regarding reference discipline, and technically focused (as opposed to behaviorally focused) regarding level of analysis. We pass no judgment on the SE field as a result of these findings. Instead, we present them as groundwork for future SE research efforts.}

 abstract = {
Software is a critical part of modern research and yet there is little support across the scholarly ecosystem for its acknowledgement and citation. Inspired by the activities of the FORCE11 working group focused on data citation, this document summarizes the recommendations of the FORCE11 Software Citation Working Group and its activities between June 2015 and April 2016. Based on a review of existing community practices, the goal of the working group was to produce a consolidated set of citation principles that may encourage broad adoption of a consistent policy for software citation across disciplines and venues. Our work is presented here as a set of software citation principles, a discussion of the motivations for developing the principles, reviews of existing community practice, and a discussion of the requirements these principles would place upon different stakeholders. Working examples and possible technical solutions for how these principles can be implemented will be discussed in a separate paper.
